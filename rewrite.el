;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Emacs supports regular expression and matching function.
;; One interesting feature is that you can refer to the m-th matched
;; subexpression specified by \(..\) as \m.
;; Although this feature is useful, it does not seems to me very
;; convenient because you have to count the subexpressions.
;; It is error prone especially when the regular expression
;; becomes complicated.
;;
;; What I wanted to realize in this package is to extend the above
;; feature so that you can NAME each subexpression.
;;
;; This package provides you a simple text rewriting system
;; in which you can write a rewriting rule
;; using matched subtext with names.
;;
;; The basic idea is the following.
;; (i)  We use a sequence of strings instead of a single string of
;;      regular expression.
;; (ii) Toghether with a suitable delimiter these strings 
;;      are concatenated.
;; (iii)We can name a string by parenthesizing it. The name is a symbol
;;      at the 'car' part of the parenthesized string.
;; (iv) The name given in (iii) can later be used to refer to the
;;      matched string.
;;
;; For example the following list represents a line of text
;; beginning with "Your response:" and the symbol 'response' matches
;; any subsequent text before a newline (and after a suitable delimiter
;; whose default value is 'white' i.e., space or tab):
;;
;;    ("Your response:" (response ".*"))
;;
;; Then you can use the symbol 'response' to refer to the matched string
;; for later text rewriting.
;; In other words the above list matches the same text as the string
;; "Your response:[ \t]*\(.*\)" does. And you can refere to the part of
;; the text matching ".*" by the name 'response' instead of '\1'.
;;
;;Rewriting System:
;; After loading this package, you can use the rewriting system
;; via 'rewrite-prog' macro. Inside this macro you can use the commands
;; as follows.
;;; (rewrite-prog <command>*)
;;; where
;;;  <command> ::= (search <regular expr seq> <search options>?)|
;;;                (replace-match <newtext seq> <replace options>?)|
;;;                (rewrite <regular expr seq> <result seq>)|
;;;                (call <s-expression>*)|
;;;                (bind (<variable name> <s-expression>)*)|
;;;                (if <condition> <s-expression> <s-expression>?)|
;;;                (while <condition> <s-expression>*)|
;;;                (progn <s-expression>*)|
;;;                (update <variable name> <s-expression>)
;;;                (insert . <regular expr seq>)
;;;
;;Definition (Environment):
;; The rewriting system maintains pairs of a symbol and the string
;; matched with it. We call these pairs the environment of the system.
;;
;;Commands:
;; Currently the rewriting system accepts the following commands:
;;   search  -  syntax: (search <regular expr seq>
;;                              <var-alist> <limit> <noerror> <repeat>),
;;              where the last four arguments are optional.
;;      This command searches the given regular expression sequence
;;      <regular expr seq>. If a matching is found, it updates the
;;      environment.
;;      The behavior when the matching is not found can be specified
;;      by one of optional arguments
;;      which are the same as those of 're-search-forward.'
;;      Its return value is also similar to 're-search-forward'.
;;   replace-match - syntax:
;;                    (replace-match <newtext seq> <fixedcase> <literal>)
;;      This command replaces the matched text in the same manner as
;;      the lisp function of the same name 'replace-match'.
;;      The difference is that the first argument <newtext seq> 
;;      is not a singlestring but a list of strings or 
;;      symbols refering to previously matched subexpressions.
;;      This command alwasy returns 'nil'.
;;   rewrite - syntax: (rewrite <regular expr seq> <newtext seq>).
;;      This command rewrites the text in the buffer matching
;;      <regular expr seq> into <newtext seq>, which is a sequence of
;;      strings or symbols representing matched subtext.
;;      It always returns 'nil'.
;;      This command is equivalent to
;;           (progn (call (beginning-of-buffer))
;;                  (while (search <regular expr seq> nil t nil)
;;                         (replace-match <newtext seq> t t))).
;;   call    - syntax: (call <s-expression>*).
;;      This command first substitutes the matched strings
;;      appearing in <s-expression>'s into the named symbols
;;      and then evaluate them.
;;      It returns the value of the last <s-expression>.
;;   bind    - syntax: (bind ((<variable name> <s-expression>)*)).
;;      This command adds a new biniding to the environemt.
;;      You can write <s-expression> to create a string
;;      or an integer to be bound to <variable name>.
;;      This command always returns 't'.
;;   if      - syntax: (if <conditional command> 
;;                          <then command> <else command>),
;;              where <else command> is optional.
;;      This command first interpretes <conditional command> 
;;      under thecurrent environemt. If the return value of <command> 
;;      is not nil, <then command> will be executed. 
;;      Otherwise <else command> will be.
;;   while   - syntax: (while <conditional command> <command>*).
;;      This command first interpretes <conditional command> 
;;      under the current environment. If the return value of 
;;      <conditional command> is not nil,
;;      then evaluate the series of <command>'s.
;;      It will repeat this procedure while <conditional command> 
;;      is not nil.
;;   progn   - syntax: (progn <command>*).
;;      This command simply interpretes each <command> in turn.
;;      It is used to turn a series of <command>'s into a single
;;      command.
;;   update  - syntax: (update <variable name> <s-expression>).
;;      This command updates the environment 
;;      so that <variable name> will be associated with 
;;      the value of <s-expression> in the new environment.
;;      If <variable name> is not found in the current environment,
;;      an error is signaled. This command returns a pair
;;      (<variable name> <value>) where <value> is a string 
;;      or an integer obtained by evaluating <s-expression>.
;;   insert  - syntax: (insert . <regular expr seq>).
;;      This command insert the string represented by <regular expr seq>
;;      in the buffer. It returns a pair of nil and the current
;;      environemnt.
;;      Note that the use of dot pair in the syntax,
;;      which means that we need no parentheses in the arguments.
;;
;; Adding Your Own Commands:
;;  You can add your own command by 'rewrite-method-def' whose syntax is
;;  given as follows:
;;    (rewrite-method-def <command name> <lambda expression>),
;;  where <lambda expression> is a lambda expression with two arguments.
;;  The first one represents the argument list for <command name>.
;;  The second one represents the environment of the rewriting system.
